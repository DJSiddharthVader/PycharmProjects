'''Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate
and then generates them. Take this opportunity to think about how you can use
 functions. Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the
 sequence to generate.(Hint: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers
 where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers
 in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)'''
